"the following statement was released by the rating agency jan 04   we view indiabased education software and solutions provider core corens as having a weak business risk profile and an aggressive financial risk profile  we are assigning our b longterm corporate credit rating to core  the stable outlook reflects our expectation that core will be able to scale up new and lowermargin businesses while maintaining moderate organic growth in existing businesses standard  poors ratings services said today that it had assigned its b longterm corporate credit rating to indiabased education software and solutions provider core education  technologies ltd core the outlook is stable the rating on core reflects the fragmented and competitive nature of the education technology market globally and the companys customer concentration in the us where clients face budgetary constraints said standard  poors credit analyst abhishek dangra the risks from cores entry into lowermargin capitalintensive businesses is also a rating weakness in our view further the company generates negative free cash flows due to its high capital expenditure and low cash generation from operations as a result of a high working capital cycle cores established presence in the niche formative assessment market with high renewal rates its wider product offerings than some education technology peers and its reducing dependence on the us market temper these weaknesses we view cores business risk profile as weak the global education technology market is fragmented companies must continually refresh product content and technology cores revenue is concentrated with the us accounting for more than 90 of revenues significant revenues come from sales to state educational institutionsauthorities that are heavily dependent on government funding budget cuts curtailments delays or changes in allocations to government programs could reduce or delay cores revenues and collections in our opinion cores entry into lowermargin and more capitalintensive businesses in the uk and india will further weaken its business risk profile until these segments stabilize we consider cores financial risk profile to be aggressive despite our expectation that the companys ratio of debt to ebitda will be less than 275x over the next two to three years said mr dangra cores working capital cycle is unlikely to improve significantly given the nature of existing clients and the companys entry into information communication and technology ict contracts we expect core to have very high receivablesat 45 of revenuesand inventories of about 15 of revenue the ratio of cash flow from operations to debt is likely to be less than 10 further we expect the company to continue to generate significant negative free operating cash flow as it increases capital expenditure and its ict business we forecast cores revenue to grow 30 per year in fiscal 2012 and 2013 driven by new businesses organic growth and possible acquisitions core has an established presence in the us with satisfactory client relationships education budget cuts in the us primarily centered on teachers and infrastructure the impact on cores focus areas was limited the companys wide range of products and services should also mitigate the risk from probable budget cuts cores expansion into different business segments in india and the uk should help diversify the business risks in our view cores liquidity is adequate as defined in our criteria we believe any significant lengthening of working capital cycles need for repayment of utilized working capital facilities large acquisitions or inability to contain the overall capital expenditure could strain the companys liquidity the stable outlook reflects our expectation that core will be able to scale up new and lowermargin businesses while maintaining moderate organic growth in existing businesses and a ratio of cash flow from operations to debt at a high single digit said mr dangra we may lower the rating if 1 working capital movements are adverse or cores operating performance is weaker than we expected such that the ratio of cash flow from operations to debt falls below 5 or 2 core faces challenges that weaken its liquidity and affect the companys ability to meet its growth plans we may raise the rating if 1 cores operating performance strengthens or its working capital cycles significantly improve sustainably boosting its ratio of cash flow from operations to debt to above 15 and 2 the company improves its business risk profile by scaling up its new businesses while sustaining modest organic growth above 10 related criteria and research  key credit factors methodology and assumptions on risks in the global high technology industry oct 15 2009

"by brian homewood berne jan 13 reuters  fifa is likely to withdraw a 20 million swiss francs 212 million financing towards the building of a new stadium in its host city of zurich because of plans to include standing areas for fans in principle fifa does not support any project which does not correspond to its philosophy soccers governing body said in a statement sent to reuters in respect to the planned stadium construction in zurich that means that if the plans are maintained to reserve some places for standing fans fifa must rethink its commitment to the promised 20 million swiss francs fifa is convinced that allseater stadiums guarantee more comfort and above all more safety therefore fifa argue for stadiums which exclusively for seated fans zurich has not had a purposebuilt soccer stadium since the hardturm the former home of grasshoppers zurich was closed 2007 the city government is planning to build a new stadium to open in 2017 which would have a capacity of 16000 for international games and 19000 for domestic games and would be used by fc zurich and grasshoppers the total cost is estimated at 150 million swiss francs both clubs currently stage matches at the letzigrund athletics stadium which was used as one of switzerlands four venues when the country cohosted euro 2008 with austria standing fans are banned in all competitions organised by fifa and european soccers governing body uefa including the world cup qualifying tournaments champions league and european championship in england standing areas were banned following the hillsborough disaster in sheffield in 1989 however standing areas are allowed at domestic games in germany where many clubs have removable seats which are taken out for bundesliga matches and put back for internationals switzerland also allows standing fans but the country also has a serious hooligan problem which many believe is to blame for the small attendances at local games in october the grasshopperszurich derby was abandoned because of a crowd riot fifa said that if the contribution was withdrawn it could be used for soccer development programmes in switzerland instead editing by john obrien to query or comment on this story email sportsfeedbackthomsonreuterscom brianhomewoodithomsonreuterscom 41 79 917 1402 reuters messaging brianhomewoodthomsonreuterscomreutersnet for the sports blog left field please doubleclick on the newslinks socclen for more soccer stories keywords soccer europeswitzerland stadium",-1

"the following statement was released by the rating agency jan 13  fitch ratings has upgraded ace insurance company cjsc russias ace russia insurer financial strength ifs rating to bbb from bbb and national ifs rating to aaarus from aarus the outlooks are stable the upgrades reflect fitchs increased confidence about ace groups willingness to support ace russia after the capital increase in q311 and ace russias improved contribution to the groups bottom line in 2010 and 9m11 the upgrade therefore also incorporates the increased contribution of the parent support to the rating and is in accordance with the principles set out in fitchs group rating methodology ace russia is part of the ace group a global insurer and reinsurer the insurer was established as a separate legal entity solely because the russian legislation does not permit crossborder primary insurance through branches the ultimate parent of the group is ace limited acen domiciled in switzerland longterm idr astable ace russia has received capital support from the group whenever required the insurer also benefits from the groups advice and close monitoring in all key areas including underwriting reinsurance claims actuarial investment and it advice in accordance with its rating criteria fitch views ace russia as standing at the important level of strategic importance within the group this is based on the deep integration of the operations shared brand name sustainable track record of support and aligned corporate governance and risk management procedures an improvement of the status to very important is constrained by the small size of the russian subsidiary relative to the group on a standalone basis ace russia would be rated more than six notches below the parent fitch also considers that capital is fungible between the parent and ace russia the agency has therefore decided to apply a partial attribution approach and reduced the difference between the group assessment and the standalone assessment benchmarked to ifs to a minimum of four notches in accordance with the agencys criteria this reduction was based on the sustainable track record of support and the strengthened performance of the subsidiary in the past two years assessed on a standalone basis ace russia has been generating a moderately positive operating result in the past three years with underwriting losses being offset by investment income excluding the effects of intragroup reinsurance and considered as if it was a branch ace russia demonstrated significantly stronger underwriting results and made a more material contribution to aces continental europe divisions bottom line than in its top line in 20109m11 ace russias shareholders increased the insurers statutory capital to rub480m from rub150m in q311 to secure compliance with new local regulatory requirements that come into force in 2012 fitch expects that the group will continue to extend capital support to ace russia when required according to fitchs internal assessment ace russias riskadjusted capital strength is very strong and is more than supportive of the insurers rating level capital appears to be somewhat excessive relative to net business volume and strong balance sheet but nevertheless is kept at the insurers level for the regulatory purposes fitch views positively the shareholders decision not to significantly increase levels of net retention or target business volume for ace russia following the capital increase fitch would view any weakening in the level of parent support to ace russia as a key trigger for a downgrade if ace russia maintains sustainable and profitable growth of its insurance portfolio and achieves a more significant scale relative to the ace group fitch could view it as a trigger for upgrade the agency does not expect the insurer to reach this target in the medium term bangalore ratings team hotline 91 80 4135 5898 bhanupriyathomsonreuterscom group id bangaloreratingsthomsonreuterscom reuters messaging bhanupriyareuterscomreutersnet",-1

"hungary expected to sign imf deal but talks seen tortuous  deal can heal hungarys economy finances but punish ruling party  pm orban expected to hold tough talks resist unravelling govt reforms  market rally seen short lived by michael winfrey prague jan 13 reuters  it may irk hungarians who have always regarded themselves as superior to their poorer neighbours to the east but romania may have lessons to teach budapest as it seeks a rescue from the eu and imf by sticking to the terms of a similar programme bucharest has managed to put its once troubled economy back on the path to growth but that path will bring short term pain and punish the policymakers who follow it facing a spike in borrowing costs that is threatening to shut his government out from foreign bond investors hungarian prime minister viktor orban has abandoned a confrontational approach to the lenders and is trying to make amends but the european union and international monetary fund are likely to demand both the unravelling of reforms that have defined his conservative fidesz administration and new measures to compensate which could lead to more austerity it was that tough stance that forced orbans romanian counterpart emil boc to push through unpopular belttightening measures despite wide public opposition and a steep drop in his popularity factors that orban will surely consider if hungary secures the deal it will stabilise its economy and promote reform but negotiations will be very tough indicating a rough ride for markets in the months ahead the imf was hardly flexible in the case of romania and it will be even less flexible in the case of hungary said nicholas spiro an economist specialising in sovereign risk it will be keen on reversing flagship reforms or things that will be acutely sensitive for fidesz voters and thats where its going to get extremely difficult orbans aboutface towards the imf has boosted the forint 3 percent this week after last weeks steep drop without a funding backstop hungary has no way to refinance 5 billion euros in debt this year two paths both hungary and romania secured rescue loans from the european union and international monetary fund at the height of the economic crisis as they faced recession capital outflows collapsing currencies and deteriorating external imbalances then they diverged in 2010 then newly elected orban ended cooperation with the fund and embarked on a progrowth strategy that raised taxes on banks and other foreignowned firms and cut them for small businesses and most hungarians he also seized some 13 billion in private pension assets to pay off state debt and with a twothirds parliamentary majority passed a raft of new laws that have irked brussels including one on the central bank that the european commission says will undermine the institutions independence citing an unpredictable policy environment the three major credit agencies have all cut hungarys rating to junk hungary is now expecting no growth or a recession but the central bank has had to hike interest rates to staunch capital flight that drove the forint to record lows last week and debt yields briefly above 11 percent yields have eased but are still at a very high 9 percent in contrast romanias boc secured a new deal in 2011 now rating agencies moodys and fitch rank the country of 22 million above hungary in investment grade and after two years of recession it looks set to outpace most of the region with 2 percent growth this year romanias central bank has also been able to cut interest rates in its last two meetings  to 575 percent  and the leu currency has lost just 25 percent against the euro over the past six months versus 142 percent for hungarys forint this has been a cure which did eventually bear fruit said laurentiu plosceanu head of the romanian association of construction entrepreneurs told reuters but it came with a price boc faced years of political turmoil and his belttightening policies  including 200000 state sector layoffs  have made him so unpopular that his government may not survive an election later this year a recent poll by the eus eurobarometer agency showed more than 70 percent of romanians the eus second poorest population think the country is heading in the wrong direction for romania it wasnt achieved without any pain it did cause quite a lot of political turmoil said william jackson from the londonbased capital economics if hungary is to arrange a deal there will be points of contention the whole process could be more difficult than what most people expect tough road ahead orbans fidesz is at no risk of losing power until elections in 2014 but his popularity has already taken a huge hit falling by nearly half since parliamentary elections in 2010 the mood in budapest is one of tension with many hungarians struggling between frustration over orbans policies and a new imf programme that could bring further pain that could give orban  a leader who rarely shies from confrontation  a reason to dig in his heels in negotiations these imf folks really will bleed us dry they come here and dictate to us who needs that said 29yearold entrepreneur ferenc hajdu i agree with viktor we must negotiate and not roll over like the socialists did a few years back we cant do that now the central bank law will probably be the first point of contention the imf may also call for orban to abandon europes highest banking tax and change tax cuts to small businesses and a flat tax his government has enshrined in the constitution but pundits say it is unlikely it will call for a reversal of his 13 billion nationalisaton of pension funds as it would be logistically unfeasible orban has said he is open to changing any law but has called for not political opinion but arguments in the talks the commission is due to complete a legal study on the issue on jan 17 ahmed imran an analyst at bank rbs said the market expects hungary to eventually accept an imf programme as well as its conditions to avoid a very extreme market event but he added that even with such a deal he did not expect hungarian assets to recover in the near term we think this is really short term relief on the forint in the end the fundamental problems are all there and credibility has arguably been lost in the administration he said additional reporting by radu

"many prominent activists among those to be freed  expremier khin nyunt freed from house arrest  releases may bring end of western sanctions closer recasts adds details throughout by aung hla tun yangon jan 13 reuters  myanmar freed dozens of political prisoners on friday in an amnesty that could embolden the opposition and put pressure on the west to lift sanctions as one of the worlds most reclusive states opens up after half a century of authoritarian rule among those freed are longpersecuted democrats and powerful ethnic leaders whose proven ability to organise and inspire others could heap pressure on president thein sein to accelerate his nascent reforms the united states and europe have said freeing political prisoners is crucial to even considering lifting the economic sanctions that have isolated the former british colony also known as burma and pushed it closer to china during five decades of oftenbrutal military rule that ended last march the release of all political prisoners is a longstanding demand of the international community and i warmly welcome these releases as a further demonstration of the burmese governments commitment to reform british foreign secretary william hague said in a statement it was unclear exactly how many political detainees were among the 651 inmates covered by the amnesty the second ordered by authorities in four months about 230 political detainees were released in an earlier general amnesty on oct 12 the assistance association for political prisoners burma a group that tracks prisoners said at least 80 had been freed on friday these included min ko naing and other members of the 88 generation students group who led a prodemocracy uprising in 1988 when thousands of protesters were killed also freed was shin gambira a wellknown buddhist monk who led 2007 street protests also crushed by the army he was 27 years old when he was sentenced to 68 years in prison in 2007 khin nyunt the oncepowerful chief of military intelligence mi was also released from house arrest appointed prime minister in 2003 he ushered in a thenderided sevenpoint roadmap to democracy but was purged a year later in circumstances that were never fully explained he had been under house arrest ever since speaking to reporters outside his home in yangon khin nyunt expressed hope for the country citing recent meetings between the president and opposition leader aung san suu kyi and visits by dignitaries such as hillary clinton who last month became the first us secretary of state to visit myanmar in 50 years these are good signs he said sai nyunt lwin 60 a prominent ethnic shan politician said he and all other leaders of his former shan nationalities league for democracy snld were freed the amnesty is a gamble for thein sein a former general freed dissidents will no doubt strengthen suu kyis movement but there are also concerns some could push for changes more radical than the government and suu kyi want suu kyi a 1993 nobel peace prizewinner released in 2010 from 15 years of house arrest will run in a byelection for parliament in april and has said she trusts the new nominally civilian government that replaced the junta in march prisoner numbers unclear washington has said it stands ready to support reforms and possibly lift sanctions but that political prisoners had to be freed first the united states has also demanded myanmar make peace with armed ethnic minorities and organise credible elections before it can consider easing sanctions on thursday the government signed a ceasefire with ethnic karen rebels to try to end one of the worlds longestrunning insurgencies although fighting still rages with ethnic kachins in the north the government has also some eased media controls the government should ensure that there are no obstacles to these activists participating in public life and upcoming elections rights group human rights watch said in a statement it called for international monitors to be allowed in to account for political prisoners that might still be behind bars the exact number of political prisoners remains unclear rights groups and the united nations have put it at about 2100 but minister for home affairs lieutenant general ko ko told un special rapporteur tomas ojea quintana in august the number was 600 or about 400 after the oct 12 amnesty suu kyis national league for democracy put the total on friday at about 500 it provides help to more than 460 people it considers prisoners of conscience said naing naing the party official in charge of assistance there were a few dozen more who did not seek its help he said the assistance association for political prisoners burma had identified 1536 political prisoners before fridays release but diplomats and some independent analysts question those numbers and say they depend on different definitions  whether rebels or those who used force to oppose the government are included

"the following statement was released by the rating agency jan 17  fitch ratings says that a possible retreat from southern europe by covered bond investors may prolong the reliance of the regions banks on central bank support our second annual covered bond survey suggests sovereign risk is making investors more cautious towards southern europe a majority of respondents  56  expect to decrease their exposure to spain in the coming 12 months almost half expect to reduce exposure to portugal and italy these are the only three jurisdictions where a higher proportion of respondents expect their exposure to decrease than to remain stable although 84 of investors anticipate adding exposure to italy this is in contrast to the overall picture of a growing appetite for covered bonds 88 of investors said they expected to increase or maintain their covered bond holdings in 2012 but their preference is to add exposure to northern europe scandinavia the commonwealth or germanyaustria this is reflected in covered bond supply in the first two weeks of 2012 which totals over eur20bn but has not included any placed issuance from banks in the eurozone periphery as we highlighted at our european credit outlook 2012 conferences last week despite the sharp slowdown in issuance of all forms of bank debt in the second half of 2011 we believe that high takeup of ecb threeyear loans and efforts that banks are making to shrink their balance sheets will enable them to refinance maturing debt this year nevertheless a prolonged exclusion from the bond markets or a permanently higher cost of wholesale funding would have consequences funding requirements in 2013 and beyond remain a concern as some banks will struggle to wean themselves off central bank support in portugal where wholesale markets have been closed for some time we see banks continuing to rely on ecb liquidity to meet their considerable short to mediumterm refinancing needs banks efforts to shrink their balance sheets and increase deposits will also help them to handle the debt maturing this year spanish and italian banks have enjoyed patchy access to the wholesale bond markets in recent months banks in both countries have issued bonds through their branch networks and in our 2012 outlook for major italian banks published in october we noted that the five largest italian banks could raise sufficient funding in this way this year however we also noted that if funding costs remain at current high levels for a prolonged period it would put pressure on profitability that could in turn put pressure on ratings in spain wholesale funding costs will remain high and competition for deposits has pushed up funding costs covered bond redemptions could provide some technical support for the market and the foreign operations of the biggest spanish banks are selffunded helping to relieve some funding pressure on the parent institutions the main factor supporting liquidity is significant deleveraging our sector outlooks for the major banks in all three countries in 2012 are negative 100 covered bond investors responded to the survey carried out in december bangalore ratings team hotline 91 80 4135 5898 satishkbthomsonreuterscom group id bangaloreratingsthomsonreuterscom reuters messaging satishkbthomsonreuterscomreutersnet",-1

"corrects third paragraph to show africa fund flows include 20 pct south africa allocations by sujata rao london jan 17 reuters  nigerias recent explosion of violent political unrest is damaging the economy and forcing investors to reassess their optimism over the shortterm returns available there and elsewhere in africa stock and bond investors started looking seriously at subsaharan africa after 2005 when debt forgiveness deals paved the way for growth and reform across the continent but anyone seeking a killing from the hottest investment pitch of the time will have been disappointed investors pumped 13 billion into african equity funds in 2010 20 percent of which were allocated to the continents powerhouse south africa epfr says this was up 10fold from 2005 these markets are a rung below emerging markets in terms of liquidity size and transparency but promise strong returns asset managers renaissance estimate nigeria  twothirds of mscis frontier africa equity index and almost a tenth of the broader frontier index  took in half this amount boosted by deep banking reforms and smooth 2011 elections expected to unleash infrastructure improvements the country was also included by goldman sachs in a group of eleven most promising emerging economies after the brics yet a dollar invested five years ago in mscis africa frontier equity index comprising nigeria kenya mauritius and tunisia would have lost 23 cents thomson reuters data shows in nigeria the loss is 36 cents an investor in mainstream emerging equities mscief would have made a 22 cent profit if you go back to 2006 expectations of frontier markets were very very high thats the difference between then and now said andrew brudenell who helps manage 180 million in frontier stocks at hsbc global asset management what you have now are very low expectations and very low valuations   in nigeria key reforms to unlock the economys potential have been slow with this months removal of the 8 billion petrol subsidy the first major step since president goodluck jonathan took office last april worse recent bombings directed at christians followed by strikes against the ending of fuel subsidies have shattered a fragile veneer of stability with the strikes estimated to have cost subsaharan africas secondlargest economy more than 600 million a day nobel laureate wole soyinka even predicts the nation is headed for civil war after last years debt default in ivory coast tunisias turmoil and currency collapses in kenya and uganda such developments revive africas reputation as a highrisk play for only the most adventurous investors in the current risk off environment frontier markets are not a shortterm story said maria gratsova an analyst at citi they are small and illiquid and thats not a good place to be when markets are extremely volatile as in past years gratsova is worried by nigerias increasingly violent sectarianism but remains bullish on it and most frontier markets saying the woes are reflected in stock valuations some 20 percent below those of emerging markets at this price you are getting access to population growth and gdp growth its not a high price to pay gratsova said risks in the price there is no guarantee that faster growth will lead to better equity performance  stocks in india and china have done poorly in recent years despite rapid growth rates but many argue africas risks are already in the price shares trade at an average priceearnings ratio of 7 times or less versus over 9 times for emerging markets says sven richter head of frontier markets at renaissance asset managers thats a significant risk premium richter says i dont expect africa to be valued on par with emerging markets but over time this premium will reduce a pe ratio of 10 will still capture some risk premium local african bonds also carry a bigger yield premium to hard currency counterparts than is common elsewhere daniel broby cio at silk invest a frontier markets focused fund says the pickup is 200300 basis points or more ghanas 10year dollar bond for instance yields 65 percent while 10year cedidenominated debt pays over 15 percent political risk is part of the scenario in africa but the risk is mispriced broby says noting that events in one country do not tend to have a fallout elsewhere buyers of african dollar debt havent fared too badly nigerias sovereign bonds returned 5 percent last year and has barely budged despite the turmoil bonds from the republic of congo and seychelles returned 1416 percent in 2011 long term investors insist longterm returns will be worth the pain incomes are rising across africa implying poor penetration levels for all goods and services from telecoms to transport will rise if reforms work up to 40 percent of nigerian firms costs come from running power generators to cover for electricity shortages analysts say a bottleneck which could be addressed were fuel subsidies redirected into power infrastructure and even within poorly performing markets there are gains to be won brudenell of hsbc for instance invested in consumer staples such as guinness nigeria which rose 18 percent last year bucking an index loss of 24 percent that shows there are some very good quality companies in frontier markets that are doing well in balance sheet and cash generation point of view he said additional reporting

"repeats dec 30 story for wider readership  us natural gas prices dip below 3  southwestern exco and quicksilver face pressure  chemical fertilizer steel cos benefit from cheap prices by anna driver and braden reddall dec 30 reuters  a steep drop in natural gas prices is squeezing the profits of producers such as southwestern gas corp swxn exco resources excn and quicksilver resources kwkn which may need to shut wells raise cash cut staff or seek merger partners in the coming year spot natural gas futures ngc1 dipped below 300 per million british thermal units on friday the lowest level in more than two years as a glut of gas from shale fields across the united states pushed inventory levels to historic highs market forecasters expect prices to remain weak in 2012 after falling nearly 40 percent since june  a boon to major users of the fuel such as chemicals and industrial companies large gas producers including exxon mobil corp xomn and chevron corp cvxn have the deep pockets to ride through the low prices but many of their smaller competitors are likely to suffer as they are heavily reliant on dry gas shares of exco and quicksilver have lost about half their value in the last six months far worse than the 54 percent drop in the nyse index of natural gas companies xng southwesterns shares have fared better since the company has hedged half its natural gas production by buying protection at around 5 gas still the companys projections show that low natural gas prices will cut sharply into both profits and cash flow typically gas producers respond to price drops by reducing spending on new wells shrinking the amount of gas that enters the market and helping to turn prices higher but analysts say more drastic action may be needed in 2012 including well shutdowns spending cuts or even employee layoffs as well as asset sales or full mergers with stronger peers theyll muck through a couple ugly months of bad spot pricing as long as they see some hope in the strip said dan morrison senior energy analyst at global hunter securities referring to nymex futures strip prices when the whole strip melts down thats what really alters behavior  graphic  weak gas prices have sparked chatter some companies could seek mergers or sell off assets on the transaction side youve always got the opportunistic guys saying oil is at a relatively high spot in the last couple of years and gas is low so im going to chase the gas right now said david knox senior vice president for negotiated transactions at the oil  gas asset clearinghouse in houston exco earlier this year explored a sale but found no suitable buyers it has said it may raise funds by selling its gas processing assets the company may find a willing buyer in its joint venture partner bg group plc bgl according to michael hall analyst at baird equity research the companies are currently partners in the marcellus and haynesville shales that may hinge on whether bg decides to pursue a vertical integration strategy to help fulfill the longterm gas export deals it recently signed with cheniere energy inc lnga hall said in a note to clients earlier this month gas winners shale fields such as the marcellus in pennsylvania and west virginia the haynesville in louisiana fayetteville in arkansas as well as new fields in ohio and other states have pushed average 2012 prices for natural gas futures on the nymex near 330 this week well south of the 4 mark that gas producers often cite as the benchmark to deliver healthy industry returns southwestern has said cash flow from operations in 2012 could fall more than 14 percent when calculated using a 350 gas price compared with gas at 450 per mcf by the same measure the companys net profit falls more than 20 percent with 350 gas southwesterns output is 100 percent gas excos production is 98 percent gas and quicksilvers production is 82 percent gas according to data from bernstein research projections that gas prices will stay low have helped many other industries that rely on gas to produce chemicals fertilizer or electricity steel maker nucor corp nuen has cited low natural gas prices as a key driver behind its move to

"onetime frontrunner finishes in fourth place  vows to draw sharper contrast with romney adds gingrich comments in paragraph 9 by steve holland des moines iowa jan 3 reuters  bruised battered and defiant newt gingrich limped out of iowa after a fourthplace finish in the states republican presidential contest on tuesday but he is still alive hit by plummeting poll numbers in recent days gingrich is likely now to hold on until the south carolina primary on jan 21 and hope for the backing of conservatives there his main rival mitt romney is expected to handily win the next vote in new hampshire on tuesday leaving south carolina as the main battleground in the early balloting for the republican nomination to challenge democratic president barack obama in the november election gingrich known for his feisty nature during his time in the house of representatives had vowed not to have a negative campaign in iowa but he lashed out at romney the former massachusetts governor blaming superpac fundraising groups linked to romney and libertarian ron paul for the negative tv ads that knocked him from atop the iowa polls together i think we survived the biggest onslaught in the history of the iowa primary gingrich said we arent going to go out and run nasty ads gingrich told supporters after it became clear he had won just 13 percent of the iowa vote but i do reserve the right to tell the truth and if the truth seems negative that may be more a comment on romneys record than it is on politics he said vowing to strike back by challenging romneys conservative credentials in the weeks ahead gingrich described himself as a ronald reagan conservative who helped change washington in the 1980s he called romney a timid massachusetts moderate  who would be pretty good at managing the decay but has given no evidence in his years in massachusetts of any ability to change the culture or change the political structure or change the government romney and social conservative rick santorum ran neckandneck in the caucuses each with 25 percent of the vote romney has a substantial poll lead in new hampshire with about 40 percent support compared to gingrichs 125 percent andy smith director of the university of new hampshire survey center said he doubted gingrich could last long beyond the south carolina vote he can carry on a bit more maybe through south carolina but he doesnt have the juice smith said team gingrich says it is wellfunded having raised about 10 million in the last quarter of 2011 the candidate could get back in the game as soon as this weekend with two debates which play to his strengths but the 68yearold gingrich looked under pressure in the runup to the iowa vote tearing up at an event when talking about his late mother and he has begun to go back on his vow not to launch negative attacks on romney newt attacks back gingrich took out a fullpage ad in wednesdays unionleader newspaper in new hampshire comparing bold reagan conservative gingrich with timid massachusetts moderate romney the ad lays out gingrichs argument that he is the more reliable conservative on a host of issues from jobs to taxes to abortion and guns republican strategists say gingrich already should have been responding to negative attacks and wonder if it is coming too late he has not run a very good campaign said todd harris who has advised several republican political campaigns theres no apparent strategy theres no apparent message gingrich accused romney on tuesday of lying over backing negative ads against him the ads highlighted gingrichs career as a washington insider and put into the spotlight the ethics violations that came about at the end of his time as house speaker in the 1990s the millions of dollars in ads literally sliced gingrichs support in the polls in half whittling him down from the leader in iowa to an alsoran far from the top finishers gingrich has acted as his own top strategist and has tried to wage an unconventional campaign focusing on his ideas and limiting the personal attacks against his rivals he benefited from his brainy performances at republican presidential candidate debates and appears to have suffered since with no debates in the past three weeks listen youve got to give newt credit said republican strategist charlie black who was a top aide to senator john mccains 2008 presidential campaign the guy went out there completely by himself and with great debate performances got into first place in the race but without a campaign underneath you an infrastructure with senior staff and a financial organization you cant compete walker said there are plans to highlight gingrichs record as house speaker in the mid1990s when he was the coauthor of the contract with america that helped republicans win control of congress i think he is going to be begin to define who mitt romney really is and juxtapose his record against his own said rick tyler who is a senior adviser to gingrichs

"by helen popper buenos aires jan 4 reuters  argentinas centerleft leader cristina fernandez hands the reins to her vice president for three weeks this month after having surgery for thyroid cancer doctors say fernandez who started a second fouryear term in december has very good chances of making a full recovery from a papillary carcinoma and financial markets reacted calmly to news of her illness idnl1e7ns1tp vice president amado boudou the former economy minister and a loyal fernandez aide will assume the presidency for the first time for 20 days from jan 4 typically a quiet time of the year due to the summer holiday season in the southern hemisphere fernandezs high approval ratings could get an added boost from public sympathy over her illness as they did following the death late in 2010 of her husband and predecessor as president nestor kirchner at a time of heightened tensions with the countrys most powerful union leader hugo moyano her cancer scare might also help quell potential labor unrest as attention turns to annual pay talks in february and march idnl1e7nm5xx fernandez won a landslide reelection in october on the back of robust economic growth and voter sympathy following her husbands death she vows to deepen the model he began in 2003 as president idnn1e79m01g here are some of the issues investors are watching policy adjustments fernandezs lowkey cabinet reshuffle at the start of her second term signalled policy continuity but signs of strain in the countrys long economic boom have already prompted her to make adjustments and public spending growth has eased sharply doubledigit inflation tight finances and slower growth are raising concerns about the sustainability of her bigspending policies as demand weakens for argentine exports days after the october election fernandez ordered energy and mining firms to cash in export revenues in the local market and ordered tax officials to approve dollar purchases on a casebycase basis idnn1e79u0ekidnn1e79p0hx both measures were designed to counter galloping capital flight and bolster the central banks foreign currency reserves which fernandez has earmarked for debt repayments next year dollar demand has slowed and the bank has resumed its greenback purchases the president has also started dismantling multibilliondollar state subsidies on water natural gas and other utilities a legacy of a 200102 economic crisis that is an increasing burden on public finances what to watch  further regulatory changes in the foreign exchange market such as a resurgence in proposals for different exchange rate for exporters aimed at boosting industry competitiveness  subsidy cuts and any signs of widespread public discontent about higher utility bills  economic activity and impact on tax revenue weaker revenue might encourage search for new ways to boost tax income one local newspaper has reported on a proposal to raise export levy on biodiesel shipments spending and finances fernandez rejects belttightening in the face of a cooling economy saying cutting spending will exacerbate the problem however primary spending growth eased 145 percent yearonyear in november according to the latest official data confirming analysts predictions that spending would cool after the presidential election idnl1e7nljiv it grew at rates of more than 35 percent for much of 2011 raising questions on wall street over how the government will bridge next years estimated 6 billion financing gap argentina which has been virtually shut out of global financial markets since defaulting on 100 billion in debt in 2002 plans to use billions of dollars in foreign reserves to pay debt for a third straight year even though socalled excess reserves have dried up idnl1e7nd8p8 the government could meet the gap by changing the rules on the use of reserves borrowing more from state agencies or going to the international capital markets after a decadelong exile fernandezs choice of hernan lorenzino as economy minister was wellreceived by investors who said the marketfriendly former finance secretary could revitalize efforts to clear up lingering fallout from the 2002 default and return to credit markets idnl1e7n62ai so far lorenzino has had a lowprofile and tight finances could discourage fernandez from rushing to reach a deal with the paris club group of creditors on argentinas 9 billion debt global risk aversion and high rates could make a bond sale unpalatable what to watch  financing maneuvers such as further direct bond sales to state agencies scrapping of excess reserves concept  efforts to agree paris club repayment and any sign government would return to capital markets  primary spending and further signs of cooler growth pay demands inflation deeper cuts in public spending  such as further subsidy reductions or caps on wage demands  will likely lead to struggles with the powerful trade union movement that provides the key support for peronist politicians like fernandez her governments longstanding alliance with moyano who leads the cgt labor federation has appeared close to breaking since kirchners death in late 2010 that has raised the risk of strikes as annual inflation estimated privately at more than 20 percent fuels union demands for pay rises and hikes to the income tax floor though a truce is likely during her medical leave idnl1e7nm5xx in her first appearance since her illness was made public fernandez called on union leaders and company bosses to exercise prudence and balance argentinas official inflation data has come in way below private forecasts since early 2007 when kirchner removed longserving staff at the consumer price unit statistics officials are working with the international monetary fund to design a new nationwide consumer price index that should be up and running by early 2014 but few economic analysts expect fernandez to make restoring credibility to the data a priority her calls to the unions and initial subsidy cuts suggest she is however concerned about price pressures what to watch  comments from unions on wage expectations any strike calls or a detente with moyano during fernandezs cancer treatment  slowdown in public spending and consumer demand that could cool prices government ties with old rivals fernandez has already flexed her formidable muscle in congress by passing several controversial laws seen by some as targeting government foes including the media conglomerate grupo clarin claba idnl1e7nf6aq she won backing for laws tightening controls over the supply of newsprint limiting land sales to foreigners and antiterrorism legislation that critics fear will allow the state to jail people for up to 15 years for activities as diverse as marching in protests or pulling money out of banks idnl1e7ns7e1 her renewed control of both congressional chambers would make it easier for her to push through more such polemical measures that would underscore her confrontational reputation a longrunning feud with clarin shows little sign of dying down last month the company accused the government of having a hand in a court raid on the offices of its cablevision cable television unit idnl1e7nk94i government relations with farmers another old rival group have improved somewhat though there was concern over the increased clout of price watchdog guillermo moreno in fernandezs new administration idnn1e7b903p what to watch  progress on a new system for corn and wheat exports current export quotas are a leading gripe among farmers idnl1e7nkbhi  any signs that

"the following statement was released by the rating agency  usbased forest products company potlatch corp recently reduced its nearterm planned harvest levels lowered its dividend and amended its credit agreement to change its financial maintenance covenants  we are affirming our ratings on potlatch including the bb corporate credit rating at the same time all ratings are removed from creditwatch where they were placed with negative implications on dec 5 2011  the negative rating outlook reflects the potential for weakerthanexpected cash flow generation and credit measures in 2012 following the companys planned reduction in harvest levels jan 4  standard  poors ratings services said today it affirmed its ratings including the bb corporate credit rating on spokane wabased potlatch corp pcho the rating outlook is negative we removed all ratings from creditwatch where they were placed with negative implications on dec 5 2011 the rating affirmation reflects the combination of what we consider to be potlatchs fair business risk and aggressive financial riskas our criteria define the terms said standard  poors credit analyst tobias crabtree however the negative rating outlook reflects the risk that potlatchs cash flow generation and credit measures could be weaker than previously expected over the next 12 to 18 months following the companys announcement that it plans to temporarily reduce harvest levels until such time as log demand improves while we are expecting a more meaningful recovery in housing starts in 2013 a key driver to log demand the negative rating outlook reflects the uncertainty around such a recovery still we expect the companys liquidity position to be adequate over this period following the lowering of its dividend and recent amendment to its credit facility that changed its financial maintenance covenants a key risk to our nearterm forecast would be weakerthanexpected pricing or demand for the companys timber and wood products if housing markets or overall economic conditions were to be more in line with standard  poors economists downside scenario for 2013 should housing starts improve to 960000 in accordance with standard  poors economists baseline scenario we would expect potlatch could begin to increase its harvest levels and accordingly generate a meaningful improvement in ebitda toward our previously anticipated levels the ratings on potlatch also reflects what standard  poors considers to be the companys fair business risk as a midsize forest products company with cyclical earnings and cash flowprimarily in wood products manufacturingand modest geographic diversity potlatch is a us timber real estate investment trust reit that owns and manages approximately 145 million acres of valuable timberlands in arkansas idaho and minnesota the company also conducts a land sales and development business and operates wood products manufacturing facilities through its taxable reit subsidiary while the companys end markets are cyclical the degree of cyclicality varies as log prices generally are more stable than lumber due to its more diversified end markets the company is committed to expanding its land holdings where it currently has a geographic footprint and regional expertise idaho and the central south however our rating and outlook do not incorporate significant debtfinanced timberland acquisitions in the next several quarters given the current market environment for the complete recovery analysis see standard  poors recovery report on potlatch published nov 8 2011 on ratingsdirect the negative rating outlook reflects our expectations that weak housing markets and lower harvest levels over the nearterm could result in credit measures that are weaker than we previously incorporated into the ratings our view of potlatchs liquidity position as adequate given its good existing cash balances revolver availability and recent amendment to its covenants provides support to the existing bb rating in addition potlatchs valuable timberland holdings and its plan to maximize the value of this asset lend support to the ratings we could lower the ratings if our anticipated increase in housing starts in 2013 becomes less likely to materialize which could further pressure the companys credit measures and ability to maintain its adequate liquidity position this could occur if housing starts over the next 18 months were to remain near 2011s level of about 600000 total starts we could revise the rating outlook to stable if a demonstrable recovery in housing markets and log prices were to occur such that we believe potlatchs earnings will improve at an accelerated pace going into 2013 for the bb rating we would expect credit measures be more in

"bucharest jan 5 reuters  romanias central bank cut interest rates by a quarter point to 575 percent for the second time in a row on thursday taking advantage of slowing inflation to support a still hesitant economic recovery the central bank surprised with a 25 basis points cut in november the first in an emerging european union country since may 2010 as it sought to encourage a sluggish economic recovery it targets inflation at 24 percent at the end of 2012 but it has to maintain a risk premium because emerging europe remains vulnerable to investor flight as the euro zone the regions main trade and banking partner struggles to cope with its debt crisis plummeting markets in neighbouring hungary which have lifted the cost of ensuring romanian sovereign debt to its highest since late november add to concerns analysts say the central bank will probably maintain a monetary policy easing bias as inflation slowed to 34 percent in november and is expected to plunge in early 2012 the leu ended last year as the regions best performing currency down only about 2 percent but was still close to 16month lows hit in november market reaction the romanian leu eurron traded almost unchanged from levels before the decision at 433 7 0 by 1031 gmt analyst comments peter attard montalto nomura international the rate cut was broadly expected and the bnr is using the relative quiet in the euro zone to lower rates back and provide some stimulus however given the situation is likely to deteriorate from here in the ez with deleveraging hitting romania hard i think they can even have to reverse these cuts sometime in the near future daniel hewitt barclays capital in london inflation is easing further down and  i think the central bank will keep cutting they are not in any hurry so they will keep cutting 25 basis points until  about 5 percent romania is not an overly active market so a few basis points will likely not move investors in or out mihai patrulescu economist at bancpost in bucharest the cut is in line with our expectations and we believe it is justified by broad macroeconomic conditions inflation has continued to ease in november to 34 percent compared with 36 percent in the previous month and we expect it to end the year around 33 percent comfortably within the banks target interval we see short term inflationary risks tame and thus expect the bank to continue the easing cycle however medium term risks persist and may trigger a stabilization in the monetary policy interest rate by the half of the year dan bucsa chief economist at unicredit tiriac bank there is still scope for further rate cuts since the real interest rate computed using the central banks inflation forecast stands at 275 percent too high for the current economic situation given that foreign demand is expected to weaken in h1 2012 a boost to domestic demand via laxer monetary conditions is welcome the cuts effect on market rates is offset by the chase for new deposits local banks bidding up deposit rates since q4 2011 a strong presence of the central bank on the money market through repos and if possible longer term repos could increase the effect of the cut we still expect at least another cut to 55 percent by mid2012 at the same time acknowledging that there is scope for more aggressive monetary policy loosening we also believe that any further cuts will probably come during the first half of 2012 since food prices will probably become an inflation driver in the second half of the year dealer with a foreign bank in bucharest if we look at the international context right now we dont see more room for cutting rates in the first quarter ionut dumitru raiffeisen bank in bucharest the rate cut was largely anticipated and is in line with our expectations inflation is going down so the central banks decision was warranted we might see a slight stimulus effect on lending but we wont see any major effect on the leu vlad muscalu economist at ing bank in bucharest the decision is in line with our expectations and it does not come as a surprise for the market i dont think this will have an impact on the leu currency either way for the currency external developments are more important and even so the spillover has been limited we see another cut this year bringing rates to 55 percent but  we expect a hike in the first part of 2013 because of a rebound in inflation market forecast six of 11 analysts polled by reuters earlier this month saw the central bank cutting rates by a quarter point idnl6e8c30tp background links  for live romanian economic data releases click on econro  overview of romanian macroeconomic indicators roeci  key data releases in central europe ceeconvergencewatch  for romanian speed debt speed guide rodebt  for romanian money markets data click on ronview editing by sam cage luizailiethomsonreuterscom4021 305 5262reuters messaging luizailiethomsonreuterscomreutersnet keywords romania rates",0

24 78 17 euro zone total yy 16 33 16 60  economists comments marco valli economist at unicredit following the steep decline in september the increase in october was a bit smaller than we expected it can be seen as a partial recovery but very much a technical one if you look at the factory pmis the downward trend lasted until december so it will persist next month in terms of industrial new orders we may see activity levelling off at the end of 2011 and the beginning of next year the downward trend remains very much in tact we believe that the fourthquarter data will be negative for the euro zone and this number goes in this direction you see quite a downward trend going on so it confirms what we have in mind industry is clearly in a recession in q4 but the leveling off in december in surveys was recorded not just in the euro zone but in the uk the us in china and also in some emerging markets it shows that probably we are starting to see a trough in the global factory cycle we may see some output stabilisation at the beginning of the year howard archer european economist ihs global insight soft underlying euro zone industrial orders and diminishing producer price inflation in november reinforces our belief that the ecb will cut interest rates further specifically we forecast the ecb to trim interest rates by a further 25 basis points from 100 percent to 075 percent in the first quarter amid ongoing weak euro zone economic activity  although we do not expect another cut as soon as the 12 january policy meeting given that the decision to cut interest rates in december was not unanimous we suspect that the ecb will want to see clear evidence that euro zone inflationary pressures are retreating appreciably we also believe that interest rates could very well come down as low as 050 percent in the second quarter of 2012 although euro zone industrial orders rose 18 percent monthonmonth in october this represented a tepid rebound after orders had plunged 78 percent in september the underlying weakness of euro zone industrial orders was highlighted by their falling 45 percent in the three months to october compared to the three months to july furthermore there were further monthly falls in orders for durable consumer goods especially nondurable consumer goods and intermediate goods in october and while orders for capital goods rose 16 percent this followed a drop of 81 percent in september the third successive and sharp fall in durable consumer goods orders ties in with belief that pressurized and worried consumers are reluctant to splash out on bigticket items furthermore many countries saw further falls in industrial orders in october as the overall euro zone performance was lifted by a 55 percent monthonmonth rebound in german orders there were further declines in france 03 percent italy 11 percent and spain 22 percent the marked overall weakening of euro zone manufacturing activity is also clearly companies pricing power this was highlighted by the fact that core euro zone producer prices fell by 01 percent monthonmonth in october as they had done in september furthermore manufacturing survey evidence for december remained weak with the euro zone purchasing managers survey indicating that overall manufacturing activity contracted for a fifth month running and at a still appreciable rate despite improving modestly compared to november there was still appreciable contraction in output total orders export orders and backlogs of work while employment growth in the sector ground to a halt euro zone manufacturers are now very much on the back foot and finding life extremely challenging as domestic demand is hit by tighter fiscal policy across the region squeezed consumer purchasing power and heightened euro zone sovereign debt tensions leading to tightening credit conditions and financial market turmoil substantially adding to manufacturers problems slower global growth has hit foreign demand for euro zone goods hard as was highlighted by the fifth successive and sharp contraction in manufacturing export orders in november reported by the purchasing managers manufacturing activity has also come under pressure from the waning of inventory rebuilding and high jumps in input costs earlier this year at least though input prices are now retreating while the recent softening of the euro will also

"by sujata rao london jan 5 reuters  a selloff in hungarian financial markets is forcing investors to weigh the possibility of a default in the european union state and the risk of contagion to other regional economies the rising cost of insuring government and bank debt in neighbouring euro zone member austria because of exposure to hungary is a case in point hungary needs to find around 165 billion this year to repay debt owed to bondholders and the international monetary fund but is effectively cut off from global capital markets as growing mistrust in its policies pushes up borrowing costs controversial new laws that are seen as undermining central bank independence and democratic checks have put hungary on a collision course with the european union and the imf jeopardising an aid deal common sense would say a default cannot happen but now we can no longer exclude this possibility it is a marginal risk but it is a risk and cracks have appeared in investor confidence said viktor szabo a fund manager at aberdeen asset management which has 7 billion in emerging debt like most fund managers szabo does not see a 2012 default as the main scenario and expects hungary to eventually meet imf conditions and sign a loan deal the government said on wednesday it might moderate some of its widelycriticised policies to please international lenders szabo said he is extremely underweight hungarian hard currency bonds and the forint the question is how far the market must push hungarian assets  its hard to guess what level of exchange rate and bond yield will make the government change their mind he said market moves have been unforgiving already the forint is at record lows while local 10 and fiveyear bond yields have shot past 11 percent 25 percentage points above monthago levels investors are also demanding a record high premium of almost 800 basis points over us treasuries to hold hungarian dollar bonds jp morgans debt index shows 11eml  hungarys economic overview hungary dollar bond spreads interest rate and currency emerging european cds  the problem is hungarys numbers dont add up according to central bank data the government had 15 trillion forints 604 billion in deposits at the central bank in november it has around 600 billion forints 241 billion worth of assets left from last years pensions grab and could sell its stake in oil and gas group mol if needed that should be enough to cover payments for at least the first half of the year but government bonds are only the tip of the debt iceberg less well known is the fact that hungarian banks for years reliant on credit lines from foreign parent banks and hit by government measures including taxes and a foreign exchange mortgage repayment scheme have external debt liabilities worth 25 billion this year against a backdrop of stress caused by the euro zone crisis hungary will struggle to get through 2012 without a substantial imf loan if aid does not materialise market stress will intensify with further rating downgrades another 200 basis point selloff in bonds and a rise in euroforint rate to 340 levels bnp paribas said predicting a 2012 economic contraction of more than 3 percent no default priced yet judging by the relative costs of hedging short and mediumterm hungarian debt markets are not yet pricing in a default while credit default swaps imply a record 700000 cost to insure 10 million of hungarian debt against default for five years oneyear cds costs are still well under that level but investors are in panic mode with few takers for 11 percentplus yields analysts note that this weeks big selloff affected hungarian cash bonds  including some in dollars  far more than cds prices suggesting that sellers were longonly investors rather than fastmoney traders there is a possibility we will continue to reduce positions as we view hungary as a momentumnegative trade says jeremy brewin a fund manager at aviva investors who cut hungarian dollar bond holdings sharply in november and december positioning on local debt is at the minimum level possible at the moment we are not expecting a default brewin said but it seems like the administration are in denial not realising that the situation is becoming quite dire and could easily tip into something more problematic contagion the unfolding crisis in hungary is starting to take a toll on neighbouring markets though the effect is still muted debt insurance costs in poland and the czech republic are up 30 basis points this week while cds in austria where banks are heavily exposed to hungary have also started rising but these markets have not surpassed highs hit at the end of november the zloty central europes most liquid currency is down 1 percent this year but has merely touched threeweek lows while 10year polish bond yields have been stable equities have been even less affected with emerging stocks up 22 percent this year and bourses in poland the czech republic and turkey also posting gains that is unlikely to continue if the uncertainty in hungary drags on societe generale analysts already suggest taking off bets on cuts to polish interest rates this year as markets take a hit from hungary they also advise selling the czech crown to position for contagion from hungary but hungary constitutes just 03 percent of the msci emerging equities index and less than 3 percent of the emerging europe index miee00000pus suggesting reaction may be limited secondly public as well as private debt ratios in all neighbouring emerging countries are much better than in hungary policymaking

"hague meets president to dine with aung san suu kyi  first visit by uk foreign minister in over 50 years  hague offers more aid prospect of much more  suu kyi says she trusts the president recasts with aung san suu kyi more hague quotes by martin petty naypyitaw myanmar jan 5 reuters  british foreign secretary william hague welcomed a pledge by myanmar on thursday to continue reforms and release more political prisoners saying such progress if sustained would lead to deeper economic and political ties with the west the twoday visit by hague is the first by a foreign minister from the former colonial power since 1955 before the military takeover in what was known as burma in 1962 it has been made possible by the handover of power last year to a civilian government  albeit one stuffed with former military men and backed by the army  and a series of political and economic reforms since then i hope weve reinforced at the highest levels of government the willingness of the international community of the uk of the european union to really strongly engage with this country hague said after meeting president thein sein adding that depended on the momentum for change being maintained britain is the biggest aid donor to myanmar according to the foreign office and hague announced extra assistance after a meeting with the president a former junta general in naypyitaw the capital built in secret six years ago this will help with microfinance to help very very poor people and additional humanitarian assistance for people displaced by fighting he told reporters of course we hope to be able to do much more in future in the field of economic and diplomatic cooperation human development but that relies on necessary political progress on reform continuing to be delivered he said  myanmar special report graphic factbox on myanmar timeline on aung san suu kyi  sustained political reform in myanmar could pave the way for stiff economic sanctions to end and lead to western investment in oil gas and other sectors myanmars neighbours in asia especially india thailand and china are already rushing in balancing act but the visit is a tricky balancing act for hague who will face criticism at home if he is seen as appeasing members of the former military regime slammed for its human rights record and brutal suppression of dissent rights violations by the army are still reported from areas where it is fighting ethnic groups hague cant appear to go soft the burma issue has become a political football at home and if hes not forthright he will be criticised said derek tonkin a prominent myanmar analyst and former british diplomat concessions would be more acceptable if supported by aung san suu kyi leader of the democracy movement in myanmar and a noble peace laureate with whom hague is to dine later on thursday and hold talks with on friday suu kyi has shown a willingness to compromise in recent months notably by agreeing to run as a candidate in an april 1 byelection after letting her national league for democracy nld party reenter the political process i dont think the pace of change is as fast as a lot of us would like it to be but on the other hand i dont think its too slow its slow but its not too slow she told bbc television in an interview on thursday i trust the president but i cant say i trust the government for the simple reason that i dont know everybody in government she added four tests earlier after meeting myanmars foreign minister wunna maung lwin hague told reporters he had asked the government for concrete progress in four areas  the release of political prisoners holding fair byelections the resolution of conflict with ethnic groups and humanitarian access to conflict areas i have assured him that if they do there will be a strongly positive response from the uk and i believe the rest of the european union hague said the foreign minister has reaffirmed commitments that have been made to release political prisoners he said the changes are irreversible and i welcome that way of thinking i stressed that the world will judge the government by its actions thura shwe mann the influential speaker of parliament and number three in the former junta acknowledged that not everyone was happy with the number of people released so far our parliament will continue to work so everyone can participate for democracy and development he said in a statement after meeting hague hagues trip follows one late last year by us secretary of state hillary clinton who also promised concrete support if myanmar moved faster on political reforms and the release of political prisoners idnl4e7mu316 britain has maintained a tough stand on human rights issues in myanmar but expressed guarded optimism after the release in october

"london jan 5 reuters  france sold 796 billion euros of longdated government bonds on thursday in a sale which drew solid demand following a recent rise in yields the average yield at an auction of 402 billion euros of 10year oat bonds was 329 percent up from 318 percent last month the sale drew bids worth 1643 times the amount on offer after 3046 times in december france also sold bonds maturing in 2023 2035 and 2041 french yields have risen in recent weeks in part due to a threat by ratings agencies to downgrade the countrys credit rating latest comments annalisa piazza market economist newedge london demand was solidbidcover for the 10year paper was a lowerthanaverage 164 times but  given the large amount on offer  the result is not too badthe paper was fairly priced versus french peers but  in our view  cheap versus germany as such dealers might have taken advantage of cheap valuations versus the bund in addition this is likely to have been the last reopening of the 10year benchmark and some richening  versus domestic peers  usually follows the end of the tapping cycle john davies rate strategist westlb london the bidcovers are down certainly for the 10year but the key thing is that they were covered france raised very close to the top end of its targeted amount so thats a positive for the market although theres been a clear concesson built into the market over recent days at the auction itself versus prevailing levels in the secondary market were not seeing yields 1015 bps higher they quite close to secondary market levels those two points are encouraging and the market will accept the slightly weaker bidcover ratios given the prevailing nervousness filtering through the market still earlier comments nick stamenkovic bond strategist ria capital markets edinburgh the auction seems to have gone reasonably well they raised close to 8 billion euros which is the upper end of their planned target yields are a tad higher than the previous auction and demand was ok so it was satisfactory but not particularly impressive the key thing is that they raised the upper end of the target and that should provide some support to the market marc ostwald strategist monument securities london all in all reasonably solid cover it has been sold with the exception of the 41s its been sold basically at midmarket levels so right in the middle between bid and offer so thats good  i am unsurprised there was always going to be a pretty solid round of domestic demand it was always going to look much better than the bund simply because you are on completely different yield levels peter chatwell rate strategist credit agricole london the aft has issued very close to the top end of the expected amount focusing heavily on 10year and 30year benchmarks i expect the initial drop in the bund when the results were released was due to the large issuance in 10s overall these auctions look ok with the large size being a factor behind the lower bidcover ratios and widening of auction tails above the average but nothing to be concerned about richard mcguire senior fixed income strategist rabobank london overall  a decent set of results but likely in line with the seemingly positive expectations heading into the sale however given the clear risk of an imminent ratcheting up of market tensions as italys februaryapril redemption hump looms closer todays sales should be seen as a successful battle rather than in any way determining the outcome of the war michael leister strategist dz bank frankfurt overall its a pretty solid auction when you look at things like bid cover and particularly the price action going into the auction where quite a concession was built in its nothing to get excited about but at the same time it should be enough to dispel concerns with regards to frances funding capacity for the time being one has to concede the fact that they went for the 10year and the 30year and obviously thats a tricky place to be at the moment given that the short end and the intermediates are so well supported by the ecb so taken together its pretty decent but probably not enough to trigger substantial relief market reaction

"wulff refuses to approve publication of phone message  president accused of pressuring paper to kill story  merkel backs wulff keen to avoid fight over successor adds wulff response to bild request background by madeline chambers and noah barkin berlin jan 5 reuters  german president christian wulff refused on thursday to approve publication of a potentially explosive voicemail message he left on the phone of a top newspaper editor in an escalating scandal that could cost him his job and damage chancellor angela merkel the move came a day after wulff went on television to try to defuse the uproar over his apparent attempt last month to pressure germanys topselling paper bild to kill an embarrassing story about a private home loan he secured in 2008 german media and opposition lawmakers have stepped up attacks on wulff who in the television interview made clear he had no plans to step down but admitted to making a grave mistake by leaving a threatening message on the voicemail of bild editor kai diekmann merkel backed wulff for the presidency in 2010 and the outrage over his conduct risks becoming a major distraction for her at a time when berlin is preoccupied with solving the twoyear old euro zone debt crisis keen to avoid the distraction of a prolonged and divisive debate about a successor merkel has supported wulff until now even as calls for his resignation have mounted mostly in the german media in the television interview wulff rejected claims that he had sought to quash the home loan story saying he only wanted to delay its publication by a day to give him time to respond bild disputes this version and diekmann wrote to wulff on thursday asking his permission to release a transcript of the message in which wulff threatened the paper with war and legal consequences if it went ahead with the story according to media reports my message given in an unusually emotional context was destined for you and no one else wulff said in a response to diekmann that was released by his office bild said it regretted wulffs decision to keep the contents secret saying it flew in the face of the presidents promises in recent weeks to be fully transparent on details of the scandal benno poeppelmann a legal expert at the german association of journalists djv told reuters he saw a strong argument for classifying wulffs phone message as nonprivate meaning bild could release excerpts from it without the presidents approval merkel ally despite the voicemail message from wulff a longtime party ally of merkel bild went ahead and published its story in middecember in it the paper reported that wulff had received a home loan in 2008 at cheap rates from the wife of a wealthy businessman friend egon geerkens when he was conservative premier of the northern state of lower saxony he is accused of misleading the state parliament when he denied having any business links to geerkens and his critics say he may have also broken ministerial law germans take the office of president seriously the person in the post is expected to act as a moral authority for the nation defending constitutional laws including a commitment to press freedoms public support for wulff has fallen to 47 percent from 63 percent in a matter of days a poll by ard television showed wednesdays television appearance in which he portrayed himself as the victim of an aggressive media was not enough for many newspapers which said the scandal was not over the affair is not over with this television interview the president has not won back the moral authority that enables him to exercise his office wrote the financial times deutschland striking a similar tone to other papers while most politicians in merkels conservative party welcomed his statement opposition members were more critical the wulff affair is not over said senior social democrat lawmaker thomas oppermann the embattled president is becoming an increasing burden to chancellor merkel who chose him mrs merkel must make clear that his behaviour is damaging the dignity of the office reporting by madeline chambers editing by noah barkin madelinechambersthomsonreuterscom49302885230reuters messaging annchambersreuterscomreutersnet keywords germany president",0

"weak demand to pressure norwegian russian export contracts  socgen outlook for british gas prices also bearish london jan 3 reuters  european gas demand will remain below 2008 levels until 2017 and the weak outlook could force suppliers like russias gazprom gazpmm and norways statoil stlol to reduce their gas prices french bank societe generale sognpa said on tuesday socgen said in a research note that it expected yearonyear demand for gas to grow by 25 percent in 2012 compared with a record 95 percent drop in 2011 our model sees gas demand reaching precrisis 2008 levels only in 2017 estimate which is not positive for gas demand going forward the bank said socgen said the weak demand outlook would put pressure on russia and norway to adjust gas pricing models with european customers around 75 percent of europes longterm gas supply contracts with russia or norway are based on indexation to oil prices with oil prices outperforming the power and gas markets in past years idnl6e7nu1dn european companies including utilities have been forced to buy gas at higher levels than they can sell power and gas to their own customers idnl6e7jc0kb socgen said that the current economic crisis would have a more severe impact than the 2009 crisis on the pricing model of those contracts gazprom is already in arbitration courts with several european companies over its gas prices and statoil is due to renew several contracts in 2012 idnl6e7m83kq as we move into 2012 the market should be focusing on the renegotiations between statoil and european buyers and the current crisis could prompt statoil to become more flexible and innovative again in terms of pricing socgen said we believe statoil could end up further reducing the assumed 75 percent oilindexation for continental buyers in order to boost mediumterm demand for gas as a fuel for power generation we suspect that after tough negotiations it could be reduced to 55 percent from october 2012 socgen said that if statoil reduced the oil indexation in its continental european contracts this year gazprom would also have to become more flexible especially for continental buyers that are able to access spot hub gas socgen said the weak demand outlook meant it had revised its benchmark british national balancing point nbp gas price forecast downward as libyan exports increase following the end of the civil war and as delayed russian exports are expected to flow to europe because of the low demand in 2011 some european buyers delayed contracted russian gas deliveries from last year into 2012 we reiterate our recommendation to sell nbp summer 12 as we expect prices to be held down by an increase in russian obligations and greater libyan exports into italy the bank said reporting by henning gloystein editing by anthony barker henninggloysteinthomsonreuterscom440207 542 6659reuters messaging henninggloysteinreuterscomreutersnet keywords europe energygas",1

"by tetsushi kajimoto tokyo jan 5 reuters  japan is weighing various ways of securing a waiver on new us sanctions against iran with reducing iranian oil imports and dealings with its central bank possible options government sources said on thursday one of the sources told reuters that japanese officials will discuss us sanctions on iran as well as europes debt crisis with us treasury secretary timothy geithner when he visits japan next week although a deal on sanctions is unlikely at that time its too early to expect a deal with the us at this stage the source said we will exchange information and convey our concerns about the impact the new sanctions could have on oil prices and the japanese and world economy us president barack obama signed into law last month new sanctions against financial institutions dealing with irans central bank which if fully implemented could hamper tehrans ability to sell oil on international markets idnl1e7nv1d1 under the law the president can move to exempt institutions in a country that has significantly reduced its dealings with iran and in situations where a waiver is in the us national security interest or otherwise necessary for energy market stability iranian oil accounts for nearly 10 percent of japans crude imports and tokyo is concerned that the new sanctions could drive up prices dealing a blow to its economy foreign minister koichiro gemba voiced those concerns in a meeting with us secretary of state hillary clinton last december the japanese government will present washington with a menu of possible options in exchange for a waiver by the end of february the source said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to media one of the options could be a cut in crude oil imports from iran and financial transactions with the iranian central bank to exempt japanese financial institutions from the new sanctions washington plans to impose against tehran the source added another government source said it was too early to talk about any specific plans and tokyo would continue to consider various options a former senior trade ministry official said there was a good chance tokyo could obtain a fourmonth waiver to keep importing iranian oil while industry worked to reduce the amount given the adverse impact an oil shortage would have on the economy i think the japanese government is trying to extend the exception as long as possible i think that is the position of the japanese government but i dont necessarily think its easy for japan to do this he said probably at least a onetime extension would be possible the question is whether a second or third extension would be possible gemba addressing reporters on wednesday before he left for turkey saudi arabia qatar and united arab emirates said one of the aims of the trip was to ensure japans energy security a possible hint that tokyo would look for alternative sources of oil geithner will meet with japanese prime minister yoshihiko noda and finance minister jun azumi on thursday after visiting china on tuesday and wednesday the treasury department said idnl1e8c41p4 the us sanctions target both private and governmentcontrolled banks  including central banks  and would take hold after a two to sixmonth warning period depending on the transactions additional reporting by linda sieg stanley white and osamu tsukimori editing by tomasz janowski tetsushikajimotothomsonreuterscom81364411829reuter messaging tetsushikajimotoreuterscomreutersnet keywords iran oiljapan",1

"bucharest jan 5 reuters  romanias central bank cut interest rates by a quarter point to 575 percent for the second time in a row on thursday taking advantage of slowing inflation to support a still hesitant economic recovery the central bank surprised with a 25 basis points cut in november the first in an emerging european union country since may 2010 as it sought to encourage a sluggish economic recovery it targets inflation at 24 percent at the end of 2012 but it has to maintain a risk premium because emerging europe remains vulnerable to investor flight as the euro zone the regions main trade and banking partner struggles to cope with its debt crisis plummeting markets in neighbouring hungary which have lifted the cost of ensuring romanian sovereign debt to its highest since late november add to concerns analysts say the central bank will probably maintain a monetary policy easing bias as inflation slowed to 34 percent in november and is expected to plunge in early 2012 the leu ended last year as the regions best performing currency down only about 2 percent but was still close to 16month lows hit in november market reaction the romanian leu eurron traded almost unchanged from levels before the decision at 433 7 0 by 10 22 gmt analyst comments mihai patrulescu economist at bancpost in bucharest the cut is in line with our expectations and we believe it is justified by broad macroeconomic conditions inflation has continued to ease in november to 34 percent compared with 36 percent in the previous month and we expect it to end the year around 33 percent comfortably within the banks target interval we see short term inflationary risks tame and thus expect the bank to continue the easing cycle however medium term risks persist and may trigger a stabilization in the monetary policy interest rate by the half of the year dan bucsa chief economist at unicredit tiriac bank there is still scope for further rate cuts since the real interest rate computed using the central banks inflation forecast stands at 275 percent too high for the current economic situation given that foreign demand is expected to weaken in h1 2012 a boost to domestic demand via laxer monetary conditions is welcome the cuts effect on market rates is offset by the chase for new deposits local banks bidding up deposit rates since q4 2011 a strong presence of the central bank on the money market through repos and if possible longer term repos could increase the effect of the cut we still expect at least another cut to 55 percent by mid2012 at the same time acknowledging that there is scope for more aggressive monetary policy loosening we also believe that any further cuts will probably come during the first half of 2012 since food prices will probably become an inflation driver in the second half of the year dealer with a foreign bank in bucharest if we look at the international context right now we dont see more room for cutting rates in the first quarter ionut dumitru raiffeisen bank in bucharest the rate cut was largely anticipated and is in line with our expectations inflation is going down so the central banks decision was warranted we might see a slight stimulus effect on lending but we wont see any major effect on the leu vlad muscalu economist at ing bank in bucharest the decision is in line with our expectations and it does not come as a surprise for the market i dont think this will have an impact on the leu currency either way for the currency external developments are more important and even so the spillover has been limited we see another cut this year bringing rates to 55 percent but  we expect a hike in the first part of 2013 because of a rebound in inflation market forecast six of 11 analysts polled by reuters earlier this month saw the central bank cutting rates by a quarter point idnl6e8c30tp background links  for live romanian economic data releases click on econro  overview of romanian macroeconomic indicators roeci  key data releases in central europe ceeconvergencewatch  for romanian speed debt speed guide rodebt  for romanian money markets data click on ronview editing by sam cage luizailiethomsonreuterscom4021 305 5262reuters messaging luizailiethomsonreuterscomreutersnet keywords romania rates",1

"the author is a reuters breakingviews columnist the opinions expressed are his own by hugo dixon london jan 9 reuters breakingviews  semantics could help save the euro zone there is a crying need to distinguish between fiscal austerity and structural reform the endless austerity programmes adopted by the giips  greece ireland italy portugal and spain  threaten to crush their economies so much that they are socially unbearable by contrast reforming pensions labour markets and the like would be good for longterm growth a policy mix that emphasises the latter and draws some sort of line under the former is needed to stop the euro crisis spinning out of control europeans have become grimly familiar with austerity spirals over the past two years a government that needs to cut its fiscal deficit embarks on a programme of tax hikes and spending cuts the snag is that this fiscal squeeze in turn squeezes the economy  partly via the direct impact of cash being sucked out of the private sector and partly because the private sector loses confidence the depressed economy means the governments tax take doesnt rise nearly as much as envisaged so the deficit doesnt decline much and as a percentage of shrunken gdp it falls even less the governments creditors led by germany then demand another round of austerity to get the programme back on track with each round the howls of pain from the population increase belief that there is light at the end of the tunnel declines and the governments political capital shrinks the greeks irish and portuguese have been trying to run up this down escalator the longest italy and spain are now embarking on the same regime yet more doses will be required over the coming year if the policy mix is unchanged after all last years budget deficits are expected to be about 10 percent for greece and ireland 78 percent for spain and portugal if a oneoff pension transfer is ignored and 4 percent for italy some austerity was needed given that expenditure had run out of control in the boom times and that in some cases there was a deliberate fiscal boost in the aftermath of lehman brothers bankruptcy in 2008 in greeces case there was also a failure to implement the programmes properly meaning time and credibility were lost but endless rounds of austerity are debilitating the better approach would be to have one chunky programme that is properly implemented and then rebuild of course the creditors arent willing to give something for nothing but this is where a semantic distinction between austerity and structural reform could be helpful both require political courage by a government and sacrifices by its people but the former pushes an economy down while the latter boosts it  albeit in the long term a virtuous cycle is even possible with the economy reviving tax income rising the deficit falling and confidence returning pushing up retirement ages is a case in point this doesnt just reduce government spending especially in the long run as savings build up year after year it also increases the productive potential of an economy by expanding its work force or take labour reform making it easier to hire and fire people puts downward pressure on wages improving an economys competitiveness and reducing unemployment  which in turn cuts government spending on social security other desperately needed reforms  privatisation liberalisation of product markets and increasing the efficiency of the public sector and the judiciary  would also improve longterm growth privatisation would have the added benefit of cutting government debts as would crackdowns on tax evasion the giips have all done something in the field of structural reform italy spain and greece for example are pushing up retirement ages but the reforms have been slow in coming and sometimes halfhearted greece is the worst example little has happened on tax evasion or privatisation meanwhile the new governments in rome and madrid have yet to get to grips with labour reform although they are indicating that they will do so soon if the giips could convince their creditors that they were serious about such reforms they would win brownie points that would put them in a better position to avoid yet more rounds of austerity after all germanys angela merkel would still be able to argue to her people that the peripheral economies were serious about change whats more the economies of germany and other creditor nations would benefit austerity in their neighbourhood combined with the threat that the whole euro zone could blow up is not good for business but to start the process policymakers and pundits need to stop talking about austerity and reform as if they are the same  sign up for breakingviews email alerts
